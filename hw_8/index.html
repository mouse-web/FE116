                React Native is an open source framework for building Android
                and iOS applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native
                capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
                platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and
                behavior of your UI using React components:
                <span>bundles of reusable, nestable code</span> .You can learn
                more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how
                components work in React Native.

                React Native runs on <span>React</span>, a popular open source
                library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make
                the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself.
                This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher
                course.
              </p>
              <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
              <p>
                <span>+ components</span>. The rest of this introduction to
                React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable
                creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>+ JSX</span>. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax
                that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
                <mark>&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;.</mark>
              </p>
              <p>
                The React docs have
                <span> a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can refer to
                learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use
                variables inside it. Here you are declaring a
                <mark>name</mark> for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly
                braces inside
                <mark>&lt;Text&gt;</mark>
              </p>
              <p><span>+ props</span>. Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</p>
              <p>
                <span>+ state</span>. While you can think of props as arguments
                you use to configure how components render, state is like a
                component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling
                data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction.
                State gives your components memory!

                TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter
                text. It has <span>an onChangeText</span> prop that takes a
                function to be called every time the text changed, and an
                onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the
                text is submitted.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, let's say that as the user types, you're
                translating their words into a different language. In this new
                language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the
                sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
